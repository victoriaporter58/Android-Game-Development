# Android Game Development - Save the World

This is a group project completed over the course of 6 months as part of a university module. We developed an android game, "Save the World", using Java and Android Studio.

Save the World is a strategic card game similar in style to Hearthstone, and has 3 difficulty levels each represented by a custom AI Bot.
